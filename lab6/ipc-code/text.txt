    The way you felt in my arms, our chemistry was sacred. Oh, I fell for your charm I was so infatuated. But you left me in the dark and my arms completely vacant, now I don't know oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh. 

    She told me that she loved me by the water fountain. She told me that she loved me and she didn't love him. 
    And that was really lovely cuz it was innocent. But now she's got her cup with something else in it. 

    It's getting kinda blurrly at a quarter past ten, and he was in a hurry to be touching her skin. 
    She's feeling kinda dirty when she's dancing with him, forgetting what she told me by the water fountain.

    Now he's grabbing her hips, pulling her in
    Kissing her lips and whispering in

    Her ear and she knows that she shouldn't listen
    And that she should be with me by the water fountain
